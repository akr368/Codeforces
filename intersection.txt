What type of role does a new grad play on the team?

What internal opportunities are there for personal growth (technical, personal, soft skills, etc.)? How have you grown since you joined this company?

What are the company (or specific team) goals in the next 6 months (or year, 5 years, etc.)?

Can you tell me more about the company culture? Is there much communication or collaboration across teams?
